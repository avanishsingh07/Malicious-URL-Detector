# Malicious-URL-Detector
Malicious URL Detector web app

I take dataset from Kaggle.
I use Logistic Regression because it is fast. In the first part I tokenizing the URL. I wrote my own tokenizer function for this.
In the next step load data and store it into a list.
I use TF-IDF to vectorize URLs.
Now convert it into test and training and performing Logistic regression.
accuracy is above 98%

I use Streamlit to create web app
